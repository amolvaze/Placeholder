# Placeholder Cross Browser Solution!

Technolgies/Languages used for project - > JavaScript/JQuery, CSS3, HTML5.

Problem: -> Placehoder is a widely used HTML5 attribute supported by modern web browsers like Google Crome, FireFox, IE etc in latest version. However, IE 9 or earlier versions
sometimes have issues while dispalying placeholders on web applications.

Solution:- This project aims to overcome this problem & one of the possible solutions has been presented.

Project makes use of JQuery & few placeholder.js files have been tried to come up with solutions.

A final solution has the code which involves a function which runs every time web page loads into DOM. This web page will be still able to show
placeholders for the input textbox, textarea fields of the web based sample form. A sample form is designed on HTML5 to test this functionality.
For password field, placeholder is masking the password showing password as a type for this project.

A solution has a Styles.css file which was initially reated to add placeholder class to the JQuery when page loads into DOM is set to run.
JQuery is being imported from CDN link of JQuery.

Results:-> A final solution is able to show placeholder successfully when web page is runnning in IE9 or earlier versions. Hence a possible
cross browser solutions has been achieved.
